					Hi there, and thanks for visiting! We originally pre-launched this site to a select audience at <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a>, getting feedback on a work in progress. What we didn't expect is the amount of interest it would gather, particularly being tweeted by someone with 300,000 followers. Oops.</p>
			
					<p>We'd like to be honest here and point out that the site is still a <strong>work in progress</strong>. That said, we add new features every day. We already have videos, the live feed, and interaction-based ranking. Today we pushed an update to help <strong>newer posts make the frontpage more easily</strong>, added <strong>five pages of top content</strong> and what should hopefully fix a problem where avatars get re-used inside discussions. If you'd like a feature, just post it - we read each and every one. As for the bugs, we're working as hard as we can.</p>	
				
					<p>
					One thing I really appreciate about the early users is the smart, thoughtful and original content. Make it interesting: an <strong>insight into your mind</strong>, something that <strong>makes you think</strong>, or something <strong>beautiful</strong>. Cheers guys. Stay awesome. 
					</p>		
			
					<p>Thanks.</p>
			
					<p>I'm Everyone</p>
