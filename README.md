# I'm Everyone

I'm Everyone is a realtime anonymous communication platform. It ran around 2010, and got a lot of traffic (it was featured on Smashing Magazine, front page on Reddit and Hacker News) but didn't make a lot of money, so it's now shut down. You can (read more about I'm Everyone on CrunchBase)[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/im-everyone].

Features are:

 - Live realtime chat
 - Embedded video
 - Threaded conversation
 - Avatars unique to each user in a thread
 - Ranking via interaction

On the backend, there's quite a neat process & queue based messaging architecture too.

I'm releasing the code under the MIT license.
